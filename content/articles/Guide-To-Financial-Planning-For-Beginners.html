        <h1>A Step-by-Step Guide to Financial Planning for Beginners</h1>
        <p>Financial planning may sound complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re a recent graduate, a young professional, or simply someone looking to manage their money better, having a clear financial plan is the key to long-term stability and success.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Financial Planning?</h2>
        <p>Financial planning is the process of setting and achieving your financial goals through proper management of your money. It involves budgeting, saving, investing, and planning for future expenses.</p>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Understand Your Financial Goals</h3>
            <p>Start by identifying what you want to achieve financially. Your goals can be short-term (like a vacation), mid-term (buying a car), or long-term (retirement savings).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 2: Track Your Income and Expenses</h3>
            <p>Understanding your cash flow is key to creating a strong financial plan. Track all your sources of income and list every expense.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 3: Create a Realistic Budget</h3>
            <p>A budget is a financial roadmap that helps you manage your income efficiently. A popular method is the 50/30/20 rule.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 4: Build an Emergency Fund</h3>
            <p>An emergency fund acts as a financial safety net for unexpected expenses. Save at least 3 to 6 months of expenses.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 5: Manage and Reduce Debt</h3>
            <p>Debt management is crucial for financial stability. Prioritize paying off high-interest debts using the Snowball or Avalanche method.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 6: Start Investing Early</h3>
            <p>Investing allows your money to grow over time. Beginners can start with Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in mutual funds.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 7: Plan for Retirement</h3>
            <p>The sooner you start saving for retirement, the better. Consider a mix of mutual funds, fixed deposits, and pension schemes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 8: Protect Your Future with Insurance</h3>
            <p>Insurance is a critical part of financial planning. Consider life, health, and property insurance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 9: Optimize Your Taxes</h3>
            <p>Tax planning can help you save money. Invest in tax-saving instruments like ELSS, PPF, and NPS.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 10: Review and Adjust Regularly</h3>
            <p>Financial planning isn’t a one-time task. Review your financial plan annually and make necessary adjustments.</p>
