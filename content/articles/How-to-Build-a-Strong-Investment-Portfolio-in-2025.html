            <h2><strong>1. Diversification: The Key to Risk Management</strong></h2>
            <p>
                Diversification is the foundation of a strong investment portfolio. Spreading your investments across different asset classes reduces risk 
                and ensures that losses in one area do not significantly impact your overall returns.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>How to Diversify Your Portfolio Effectively</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Invest Across Asset Classes</strong> – Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and real estate.</li>
                <li><strong>Sector Diversification</strong> – Choose stocks from technology, healthcare, energy, and finance sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>Geographical Diversification</strong> – Invest in both domestic and international markets to protect against local downturns.</li>
                <li><strong>Short-Term & Long-Term Investments</strong> – Balance your portfolio with high-growth stocks and stable bonds.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><strong>2. Choosing the Right Investment Instruments</strong></h2>

            <h3>Best Investment Options for 2025</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mutual Funds & ETFs</strong> – Ideal for professionally managed portfolios.</li>
                <li><strong>Stocks</strong> – Choose blue-chip companies, dividend-paying stocks, and growth stocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Bonds & Fixed Deposits</strong> – Great for risk-averse investors seeking stable returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Estate</strong> – Provides passive income and long-term appreciation.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold & Commodities</strong> – A hedge against inflation and economic instability.</li>
                <li><strong>Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets</strong> – High-risk, high-reward investments.</li>
            </ul>
