            <h2>1. Diversification: The Key to Risk Management</h2>
            <p>
                Diversification is the foundation of a strong investment portfolio. Spreading your investments across different asset classes reduces risk
                and ensures that losses in one area do not significantly impact your overall returns.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Diversify Your Portfolio Effectively</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Invest Across Asset Classes – Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and real estate.</li>
                <li>Sector Diversification – Avoid investing too much in a single industry. Choose stocks from technology, healthcare, energy, and finance sectors.</li>
                <li>Geographical Diversification – Invest in both domestic and international markets to protect against local economic downturns.</li>
                <li>Short-Term & Long-Term Investments – Balance your portfolio with high-growth stocks and stable bonds for steady returns.</li>
            </ul>
